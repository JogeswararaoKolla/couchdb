Query Data from Couch using N1QL Query 

Couchbase Server 
open-source,distributed,NoSQL document-oreiented database optimized for interactive apps
;used N1QL Query language                               

Document-oreiented Database 
Category of NoSQL databases that store all information for an Object 
within a document rather than in a table. 

NoSQL Database Generic term used for any non-relational database

Relational Database 
Generic term used for an database that stores data logically organized into relations 
- tables with rows and columns 

NoSQL Databases 
  key-value stores -> document-oreiented databases -> Couchbase 
  Graph Databases 

Document-oreiented databases
  Semi-structured Data 
  Document as logic unit 
  More flexible schemas 
  Languages other than SQL; Couchbase uses N1QL 
  Data for one entity in one document 
  Metadata embedded in document structure 

Relational Database 
  Structured Data 
  Relation (table) as logical unit 
  Rigidly enforced schemas 
  SQL-based access 
  Data for one entity across tables 
  Metadata (Schema,Constraints) reside outside relation 

Couchbase Architecture 
  Data - Data representation 
  Couchbase stores data as items
  Each item is key and a value 
  We will have multiple items (key value pairs) for an entity
  value must be either 
  - Binary
  - JSON Document 
    Keys : UTF-8 strings, no spaces, <250 Bytes 
    - Unique within the bucket 
    Values : <20 MB, Binary or JSON
      - Binary values can not be parsed or indexed, only retrieved by key 
      - Documents refers to JSON value 
        - Consist of attributes 
        - Attribute values can be 
        - Basic types : number, string, boolean
        - Complex types : Array,embedded document  
 
  Storage 
  Data items stored in Buckets 
    - Couchbase buckets exists both in memory or disk 
    - Ephemeral buckets: only in memory 
  Buckets are created and names by apps 

  Architecture 
  Each instance of Couchbase Server run several services 
    - Data service 
    - Data is stored and retrieved items by the keys 
    - Query Service 
    - Parse the N1Ql Query, Running the query and retrieving the data 
    - Indexing service 
    - Search service 
    - Analytics
    - Eventing  

  Distributed Nature 
  Each Couchbase server instance runs on a node 
  Multiple nodes can be combined into a cluster 
  Cluster manager regulates all nodes 
  Add, remove, update nodes without cluster going down
    - Cluster adminstration can be done with web console 
  Various Data replication options are available
    - Data can be evenly distributed across multiple nodes and also replicated
    - can replicate across different data centers for maximum availability
    - Node failure, node removal do not cause data loss 
  Individual services can be distributed across multiple nodes 
  High priority work loads can be distributed and scaled
