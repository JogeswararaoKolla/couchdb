Query Data from Couch using N1QL Query 

Couchbase Server 
open-source,distributed,NoSQL document-oreiented database optimized for interactive apps
;used N1QL Query language                               


Document-oreiented Database 
Category of NoSQL databases that store all informaiton for an Object 
within a document rather than in a table. 

NoSQL Database Genereic term used for any non-relational database

Relational Database 
Generic term used for an database that stores data logically organized into relations 
- tables with rows and columns 

NoSQL Databases 
  key-value stores -> document-oreiented databases -> Couchbase 
  Graph Databases 

Document-oreiented databases
  Semi-structured Data 
  Document as logic unit 
  More flexible schemas 
  Languages other than SQL; Couchbase uses N1QL 
  Data for one entity in one document 
  Metadata embedded in document structure 

Relational Database 
  Structured Data 
  Relation (table) as logical unit 
  Rigidly enforced schemas 
  SQL-based access 
  Data for one entity across tables 
  Metadata (Schema,Constraints) reside outside relation 

Couchbase Architecture 
Data - Data representation 
Couchbase stores data as items
Each item is key and a value 
We will have mutiple items (key value pairs) for an entity
value must be either 
- Binary
- JSON Document 
  Keys : UTF-8 strings, no spaces, <250 Bytes 
    - Unique within the bucket 
  Values : <20 MB, Binary or JSON
    - Binary values can not be parsed or indexed, only retrieved by key 
    - Documents refers to JSON value 
      - Consist of attributes 
      - Attribute values can be 
        - Basic types : number, string, boolean
        - Complex types : Array,embedded document
